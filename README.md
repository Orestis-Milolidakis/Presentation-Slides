# Presentation-Slides

Here are a few presentation slides I made during my studies. Specifically:

## Linear programming theory
**Lower bounds on the sizes of integer programs without additional variables**: We often formulate combinatorical optimization problems as integer linear programs to solve them. Just how small can we make this program? We go over the paper of Kaibel and Weltge, and more recent results.

## Parameterized Algorithms

**Parametrized hardness results for game theory:** If computing the nash-equilibrium is hard, then surely there must be fixed-parametre approaches to the problem. We go over Mahdi Parsa's paper.
**Listing All Maximal Cliques in Sparse Graphs in Near-optimal Time:** If Max-clique is NP-complete, then why is printing all maximal cliques of a graph easy in practice? As it turns out, real worlds graph have low degeneracy, and printing all maximal cliques has a decent running time parameterized under degeneracy. We go over Eppstein, ooffler, and Strash's paper. In Greek. 

## Approximation Algorithms
**The Geometry of Scheduling:** Scheduling problems are difficult to even make approximation algorithms for. We go over the result of Bansal and Pruhs, who find approximation algorithms for a large family of scheduling problems by reducing them to a geometric problem. In Greek.

## Graph Theory
**Tree packing and covering:**
We present chapter 2.4 of Diestel's book, where two classic results of the 60s are easily proven by the more recent Packing-covering theorem.
